        <img src="./images/browsFancy.jpeg" class="brows1">
        <p id="aboutText">Microblading is a type of semi-permanent makeup where pigment is implanted into the second layer of skin through a manual process creating hairlike strokes.
        <br><br>
        The artist carefully designs your brows based on you your facial structure, precise measurements, natural brow hair, and your desired look.
        <br><br>
        This dexterous technique gives the illusion of real hair. The effects last from one to three years, but it is recommended to have an annual color boost to keep your brows looking fresh.
        <br><br>
        The pain is minimal -- most clients say it feels like threading many hairs. The area is numbed with a topical lidocaine numbing cream along with a medical grade numbing gel throughout the procedure.
        <br><br>
        Healing takes about two weeks. A free touch-up appointment will be fulfilled four to six weeks after the initial treatment.
        <br><br>
        Microblading is about life-changing and long-lasting results.
        <br>
        Save precious time and money by never having to fill in your brows with makeup again.
        <br>
        Enhance existing brows with stunning shape and lift.
        <br>
        Improve sparse brows caused by over plucking.
        <br>
        Beautiful shape and added definition lifts the eyes for a younger look.
        <br>
        Natural hair strokes add thickness and results in natural looking brows.</p>

        <h2 id="aboutHeading2">After Treatment</h2>
        <p id="aboutText">
          Do not touch or wet area the day of procedure.
        <br>
        On days 1-7 gently wash morning and night, with an antibacterial soap to remove bacteria.
        <br><br>
        <b>WASH HANDS before cleansing brows.</b>
        <br><br>
        With a very light touch, use your fingertips to gently cleanse the eyebrows. Rub the area in a smooth motion for ten seconds and rinse with water ensuring that all soap is rinsed away.
        <br><br>
        To dry, gently PAT, not rub, with a clean tissue or gauze.
        <br><br>
        Do not use any cleansing products containing acids (glycolic, lactic, or AHA), or any exfoliants.
        <br>
        After area is dry, apply a rice grain amount of healing ointment (Aquaphor) to each eyebrow using a clean cotton swab and spread it across area.
        <br><br>
        Be sure not to over apply the ointment as this will suffocate the skin and delay healing. The ointment should be a thin, and barely noticeable on the skin.

        <h2 id="aboutHeading2">Healing Process and What to Expect</h2>
        <img src="./images/browsAndCoffee.jpg" class="brows5">
        <p id="aboutText">The healing process for microblading varies for every client. Every clients body and skin reacts to the procedure different and proper aftercare will give best results.
        <br><br><b>Common Side Effects:</b><br><br>
        Red or pink tenderness in the area.<br><br>
        Mild swelling.<br><br>
        Moderate scabbing 3-5 days after the procedure.<br><br>
        Scabs will start to flake off between days 5-10. <br><br>
        DO NOT PICK OFF. Allow them to fall off naturally.<br><br>
        Eyebrows will appear very dark until the scabs naturally flake off.<br><br>
        After scabs are off, the pigment might look light, grey, or blurry.<br><br>
        In four weeks after the procedure is fully healed, the pigment will return to full color
